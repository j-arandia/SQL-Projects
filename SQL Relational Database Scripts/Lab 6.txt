1. Determine the last used employee Id


SELECT MAX(Id) AS LastUsed FROM Employees;

2. Create a new SEQUENCE for the Employees table. Have the new sequence start at the next available multiple of 5 and increment by 5’s


CREATE SEQUENCE employees_id_seq
INCREMENT BY 5
START WITH 610
NOCACHE
NOCYCLE;


3. Add a single SELECT statement to confirm the sequence exists by selecting it from the meta data table USER_SEQUENCES


SELECT sequence_name, min_value, increment_by, last_number
FROM user_sequences WHERE sequence_name = 'EMPLOYEES_ID_SEQ';

4. Add an INSERT statement to add a new employees to the employees table using the following data:
• Primary key - use the sequence’s next value
• First Name – Sidney
• Last Name – Crosby
• Street Address – 28 Hanbury Drive
• City – Cole Harbor
• Province – Nova Scotia
• Postal Code – B4R
• Area Code – 902,
• Phone – 555-1111
• Birth Date - 1987-08-07



INSERT INTO Employees (Id, FirstName, LastName, StreetAddress, City, Province, PostalCode, AreaCode, PhoneNumber, BirthDate)
VALUES (employees_id_seq.nextval,'Sidney', 'Crosby', '28 Hanbury Drive', 'Cole Harbor', 'NS', 'B4R', '902', '555-1111', '1987-08-07');


5. Add another INSERT statement to add another employee using the following data:
• Primary key - use the sequence’s next value
• First Name – Ron • Last Name – McClean
• Street Address – 231 Maple Ave
• City – Oakville
• State - Ontario
• Postal Code – L4X-1L9
• Area Code – 289
• Phone – 555-1551
• Birth Date - 1960-04-12



INSERT INTO Employees (Id, FirstName, LastName, StreetAddress, City, Province, PostalCode, AreaCode, PhoneNumber, BirthDate)
VALUES (employees_id_seq.nextval, 'Ron', 'McClean', '231 Maple Ave', 'Oakville', 'ON', 'L4X-1L9', '289', '555-1551', '1960-04-12');

6. Add a Select statement to the script to retrieve all data for the 2 new employees, plus your name (not mine) as a constant


SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, StreetAddress, City, Province, PostalCode, AreaCode, PhoneNumber, BirthDate, 'Jassika Arandia'
FROM Employees WHERE Id > 608;


7.  Add a single Update statement to the script to update all of the new Employees so that both new employees postal code is (L4X-1L9)


UPDATE Employees SET PostalCode = 'L4X-1L9' WHERE Id > 608;


8. Issue the same select as in step 6 again to show the new postal codes


SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Id > 608;


9. Add a single DELETE to the script to remove the 2 new employees	


DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Id > 608;


10. Issue a SELECT to dump out the remaining employees 


SELECT * FROM Employees;


11. Add a drop to the script to remove the sequence created in step 2



DROP SEQUENCE employees_id_seq;


12. Repeat the code from the SELECT statement from step 3 showing the meta data again


SELECT sequence_name, min_value, increment_by, last_number
FROM user_sequences WHERE sequence_name = 'EMPLOYEES_ID_SEQ';
